# Integrated-Object-Detection-and-Scene-Analysis-Waste-Classification-Using-YOLO-and-NLP-Techniques
Waste classification and management are important
 for healthier planet Earth. In this paper we are proposing an
 integrated approach for waste detection and classification using
 object detection along with natural language processing (NLP)
 techniques. which introduce a YOLO-based model to detect and
 classify waste in images by using Bootstrap Language-Image
 Pretraining (BLIP) for scene understanding and contextual
 analysis.
 The workflow involves, feeding the waste images into a
 preprocessing stage (image), captioning image data with Natural
 Language Processing (NLP) to produce descriptive captions, and
 analyzing the textual features of detected captions that exist in
 the waste (waste elements). The classification of the detected
 object is performed by a custom trained YOLOv8 model which
 is fine-tuned on a specific waste class dataset. Experiments show
 that the model recognizes garbage, recyclables and litter with
 high accuracy. This system showcases the potential of combining
 visual and textual modalities to enhance waste detection accuracy,
 offering a robust tool for automated environmental monitoring
 and management.
